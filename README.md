## Abstract

This project presents a comprehensive workflow for the modeling, validation, and analysis of the Dobot Magician robotic manipulator using MATLAB and its Robotics System Toolbox. The tasks include implementing forward and inverse kinematics, building both symbolic and URDF models, validating results on the physical robot, solving constraints using the Inverse Kinematics Designer app, and analyzing the robot’s workspace through manipulability indices. Completed as part of the official MathWorks course on robotic manipulators, the project provides a detailed understanding of manipulator control, modeling strategies, and performance optimization.

## Introduction

Modern robotic manipulators are vital to advanced manufacturing, medical robotics, and automation systems, thanks to their precision in controlling end-effector position and orientation. This project applies foundational and advanced kinematics concepts to the Dobot Magician robot using MATLAB, combining simulation with hardware testing.

---

## Problem Statement

Accurate real-time motion control and workspace planning for robotic arms like the Dobot Magician depend on precise kinematic modeling and understanding manipulability limits. This project bridges the gap between theoretical models and practical validation, providing a full pipeline from kinematics definition to workspace analysis, all within MATLAB.

---

## Motivation

Mastering the control and analysis of robotic manipulators is essential for robotics, automation, and manufacturing engineers. The Dobot Magician, popular in education and research, provides a practical context for applying theory. This project leverages the official MathWorks course for structured learning and hands-on skill-building.

## Forward and Inverse Kinematics

- **Forward Kinematics (FK):** Implemented using Denavit–Hartenberg (DH) convention to compute end-effector pose from joint angles.
- **Inverse Kinematics (IK):** Both symbolic (geometric) and numerical (optimization-based) methods were used. Symbolic methods handled simple poses, while MATLAB’s `inverseKinematics` class solved complex configurations.

Validation was performed through simulation and direct hardware trials, with high alignment achieved between simulated and actual robot behavior.

---

## Robot Modeling Techniques

Two modeling approaches were developed:

1. **Symbolic Rigid Body Tree Model:**  
   Built manually using MATLAB’s `rigidBodyTree` structure for deep understanding and full parameter control.

2. **URDF-Based Model:**  
   Imported from a URDF file derived from the Dobot Magician Lite CAD model, enabling quick prototyping and accurate visualization.

---

## Real Hardware Validation

Joint angle solutions were deployed to the physical Dobot Magician using MATLAB. The robot’s actual movements closely mirrored simulation results, with minor discrepancies due to mechanical slack and calibration tolerances. This confirmed the models’ suitability for real-world planning and control.

---

## Inverse Kinematics Designer App

The app was used to:

- Interactively apply joint constraints
- Visually adjust and constrain target poses
- Select and tune solvers for improved performance

Solver settings and joint configurations could be saved and exported for easier validation and understanding of constraint effects.

---

## Workspace Analysis and Manipulability

Workspace analysis was conducted using sampled joint configurations to map the 3D volume accessible to the end-effector.

**Manipulability Indices Used:**
- **Yoshikawa Index:** Measures overall dexterity.
- **Inverse Condition Number:** Identifies numerically unstable or singular configurations.
- **Asada Index:** Assesses force/motion exertion capabilities.

Analysis showed higher manipulability near the base and central workspace, with lower values near joint limits—vital for planning high-precision or high-payload tasks.

## Course Completion and Deliverables

As part of the official MathWorks course, the following were completed:

- Source code for all kinematic and simulation tasks
- FK/IK models (symbolic and URDF)
- Snapshots and exports from IK Designer App
- Workspace analysis plots and reachability maps
- Full technical report
- Verified screenshot of course completion

## Conclusion

This project demonstrates a complete workflow for robotic modeling, simulation, and validation using the Dobot Magician as a platform. From low-level transformation logic to high-level manipulability metrics, the experience provided robust, industry-relevant skills in MATLAB-based robotics programming, modeling, analysis, and hardware testing.
